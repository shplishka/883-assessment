# Final Exercise Introduction Hadoop Ecosystem concepts Q&A :question:

## Goals:
- Gain a foundational understanding of the Hadoop ecosystem.
- Explore key components and their roles in big data processing.
- Make connections between the Hadoop ecosystem and real-world use cases.
- Develop a high-level understanding of the Hadoop ecosystem and its role in big data processing.
- Familirize yourself with the Hadoop ecosystem and its role in big data processing.
- Start to work with time estimation and planning.
- Learn to ask questions and how to find the answers with deep understanding of the whole concept.

:warning: **Note:**
- Maybe this is the first time you need to answer questions with your own words, so take your time to read the instructions carefully and ask your mentor if you have any questions.
- Take time to think about the answers, don't just copy-paste from the internet.
- Try to differ between the important and less important information.
