# Day 05 - Mastering OOP and Design Principles with Test-Driven Development (TDD) üé®

## Overview

**Goals:**

- Grasp fundamental design principles and the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Explore how these concepts shape robust, maintainable, and scalable software designs.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:**

- Understanding OOP and design principles is crucial for creating sophisticated and adaptable code architectures.
- Aim to not just understand these concepts theoretically but also consider how you can apply them practically in your coding endeavors.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Design and OOP

**Est. Time: 4 hours**

### Core Concepts

1. **Design Principles:**

   - Understand the fundamental design principles like SOLID, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).
   - Explore how these principles guide the creation of flexible, maintainable, and scalable systems.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

   - Dive into the core concepts of OOP - encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   - Understand how OOP principles promote code reuse, modularity, and clarity.

3. **Design Patterns:**

   - Get introduced to common design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Decorator.
   - Understand how design patterns provide proven solutions to common software design problems.

4. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - **PyTest (for Python)**: [PyTest Official Website](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)

## Application and Discussion

**Group Discussion (1 hour):**

- Engage in a group discussion to share insights and key takeaways from the concepts learned.
- Discuss real-world scenarios where applying these principles and patterns has significantly improved the software design.

## Wrapping Up the Day

**Reflection and Planning (30 minutes):**

- Reflect on the learnings of the day and how you can apply the principles of design and OOP in your daily work.
- Plan your approach for integrating these best practices into your coding routine.

Congratulations on completing Day 05! You're now equipped with the principles that will guide you in designing and structuring your code effectively.
