# Day 05 - Guiding New Developers in OOP, Design Principles, and TDD üå±

## Overview

**Goals:**
- Mentor new team members in understanding and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and design principles in their projects.
- Facilitate discussions and practical exercises to reinforce the concepts of robust, maintainable, and scalable software design.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:**
- As a mentor, your role is crucial in transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills.
- Encourage new team members to ask questions and think critically about how design principles and OOP can be integrated into their daily coding practices.

## Chapter 1: Mentoring in Design and OOP

**Est. Time: 4 hours**

### Core Concepts

1. **Review of Design Principles:**
   - Guide discussions on SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles.
   - Provide examples from your own experience where applying these principles improved code quality and maintainability.

2. **Deep Dive into OOP:**
   - Encourage new team members to present their understanding of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   - Discuss how these principles can be practically applied in current or upcoming projects.

3. **Exploring Design Patterns:**
   - Facilitate a workshop on design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Decorator.
   - Encourage team members to identify potential use cases for these patterns in their work.

4. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
   - Share best practices and tips on integrating TDD into the development workflow.
   - Organize a hands-on session where team members can practice writing tests first and then writing code to pass the tests.

## Mentoring Sessions

**One-on-One Sessions (2 hours):**
- Schedule individual sessions with each team member to address specific questions or challenges they are facing in understanding or applying OOP and design principles.
- Review code written by team members and provide constructive feedback, highlighting areas where design principles and OOP can be better applied.

**Group Coding Exercise (2 hours):**
- Conduct a group coding session focused on refactoring a piece of existing code.
- Guide the team in identifying code smells and applying OOP and design principles to improve the codebase.

## Wrapping Up the Day

**Feedback and Iterative Learning (30 minutes):**
- Provide feedback on the day's activities and any code written during the sessions.
- Encourage team members to continuously learn and apply design principles and OOP concepts in their daily tasks.

Your mentorship today has helped lay a strong foundation in OOP and design principles, empowering new team members to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Keep nurturing these skills, and watch them grow into confident and proficient developers. üöÄ
