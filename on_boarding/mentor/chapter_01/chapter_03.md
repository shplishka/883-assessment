In my view, the onboarding process may initially appear redundant, as team members can readily resort to internet searches when confronted with problems. However, the true significance of onboarding goes beyond just finding solutions online. Its purpose is to instill confidence in new team members, enabling them to:

- Navigate our systems effectively
- Grasp core concepts
- Discern the interplay between different components
- Appreciate the overall synergy within our organization.

The onboarding process aims to empower new team members, equipping them with the skills needed to approach our systems with competence. It extends beyond mere problem-solving via search engines, ensuring that team members are well-prepared to contribute meaningfully and comprehend how each facet of our organization interfaces with the others. Ultimately, it fosters the development of a holistic mindset necessary for success within our team.
